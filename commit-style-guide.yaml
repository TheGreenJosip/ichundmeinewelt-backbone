    chore(codegen): configure GraphQL Code Generator and generate initial schema/types

    - Installed and configured @graphql-codegen/cli with plugins for TypeScript types and schema introspection
    - Added codegen scripts to package.json for one-off and watch mode generation
    - Generated schema.json from Keystone GraphQL API for offline tooling (e.g., Insomnia)
    - Generated src/types/graphql.ts with type-safe schema and resolver signatures
    - Verified successful generation via pnpm codegen
    - Note: generated types are not yet leveraged in Keystone models, hooks, or resolvers
